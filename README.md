# Content Management System (CMS)

Most content management systems are in default totally overloaded
with plugins which should be optional packages and bring 2-4 layers for development
so you have to learn multiple programming languages and some bbcode like syntaxes.
These layers only consume performance, give you a minimum plus in security
and often they make the code mostly unreadable for people
who did not work with the cms for weeks/months.
 

##  We try to make it better,
so we give you a cms were you only need to know the basics

* PHP 5.5+
* SQL
* HTML 5
* jQuery 2 (optionally but recommended)
* Bootstrap 3 (optionally but recommended)

All this is basically standard for websites today, so most web-developers
know how to work with our cms after 5 minutes of reading documentation.
And of course its OpenSource under 

## dual-license
1. [LGPLv2.1](https://github.com/SeriousPro/cms/blob/master/LICENSE1)
2. [LGPLv3](https://github.com/SeriousPro/cms/blob/master/LICENSE2)

so you can use it for all of your website projects, no matter they are for private or business use
and of course you are allowed to sell plugins and/or themes for this cms..
